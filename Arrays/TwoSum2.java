/*
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. 

Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, 
added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. 
You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.
